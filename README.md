# Automated-Attendance-System-using-Facial-Recoginition


Abstract:
The uniqueness of an individual's face represents their identity, which is now being utilized for automated attendance tracking in this project. Attendance is a vital aspect of any institution, be it a college, university, or school. The traditional method of taking attendance by calling out student names or roll numbers and manually recording attendance is time-consuming. With subjects averaging around 60 minutes or an hour, recording attendance takes 5 to 10 minutes, wasting valuable time for the instructor. To eliminate this problem, image processing is used for automatic attendance taking. The project utilizes face detection to locate the position of the face region and face recognition to mark the student's attendance. The class database stores all the students' information, and when an individual student's face matches one of the faces stored in the database, their attendance is marked.
